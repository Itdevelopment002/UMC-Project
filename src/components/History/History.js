                Ulhasnagar is a municipal town and the headquarters of the Tahsil
                bearing the same name. It is a railway station on the Mumbai-Pune
                route of the Central Railway. Ulhasnagar, a colony of migrants in
                the aftermath of Partition, is 43 years old. Situated 58 Kms from
